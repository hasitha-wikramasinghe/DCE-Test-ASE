//****** This is a readme file for backend test, Please be kind enough to read this doc before reviewing the code ******//

* You can see two folders inside the backend folder
	1 - DB scripts folder
	2 - Backend project solution folder

Steps that you can follow for better review...
1. You can see script file as "Table creation scripts" inside db scripts folder, and you can use it for table creation on SSMS
2. After that you can use "Data Seeding" script to seed the database from some dummy data.
3. And now you can go back and open solution and use it
4. Now you can use API Postman collection to check the API

Thank you.
